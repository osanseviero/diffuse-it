# Diffuse it! ðŸ§¨

Create your ML models and demos for generating images for a word you specify in a couple of minutes! 

## Usage

## How does it work?

### 1. You define which term to use

### 2. We download ~150 images and use them to train a Diffusion model using the `diffusers` library.

### 3. We push the model to Hugging Face Hub to share the model with the world

### 4. We create a demo so anyone can try it out, even if they don't know code!
